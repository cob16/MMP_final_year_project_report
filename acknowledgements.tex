\end{center}

I would like to thank everyone for there support in helping me to produce this report. In particular, I would like to thank my support tutor, Heather Philips for helping me stay organised for the last three years of my degree. I would also like to thank my supervisor, Dave Price for his help in learning the details of amateur radio and its terminology. Many thanks also to Peter Todd, for his help with the physical side of the project as well as for putting up with my barrage of questions about serial and electronics. 

I would also like to thank my friends Owen Garland, Xander Barnes and Nicholas Dart for helping my studies at Aberystwyth University stay both focused and entertaining.

Of course I would never have even been able to even write this acknowledgement section without the enduring love and support of my parents, Mark and Christina. They helped me through my childhood and gave me the opportunity to find and pursue my interest in computing.

Finally I would like to thank Laura Pugh for all her love and support that she has given me throughout my undergraduate degree. She is the most kind person I know and has put up with me moving over 600km away to Germany for my industrial year.
